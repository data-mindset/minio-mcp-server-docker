# Quick Reference - MinIO MCP Server

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Environment Isolation

**The chatbot's code interpreter and MCP server run in SEPARATE environments!**

Files created by the chatbot are NOT accessible to the MCP server.

## ‚úÖ Correct Patterns

### Upload Text Content
```
‚ùå DON'T: "Create report.txt then upload to MinIO"
‚úÖ DO: "Create file report.txt in bucket mybucket with: content here"
```

### Upload JSON Data
```
‚ùå DON'T: "Generate data.json and upload it"
‚úÖ DO: "Save this JSON to bucket mybucket as data.json: {\"key\": \"value\"}"
```

### Upload Images
```
‚ùå DON'T: "Generate image then upload to MinIO"
‚úÖ DO: Upload manually to MinIO first, then organize with MCP
‚úÖ OR: "Download image from [URL] and save to bucket X"
```

### Process and Upload
```
‚úÖ DO: "Download data.csv from bucket source, analyze it, then create summary.txt in bucket dest with the results"
```

### Copy Between Buckets
```
‚úÖ DO: "Copy file.pdf from bucket source to bucket destination"
```
